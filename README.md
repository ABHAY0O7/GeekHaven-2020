## ðŸ§© What Makes It Unique 
The special thing about the 2020 Revamp project is that we're making the website dynamic, so that the data can be updated without hampering the code, simply by the use of some PHP and MySQL
### Dynamic listings
Projects, Blogs, Announcements and even the PNGs and SVGs can be added/deleted/updated anytime.
### Transfer of Authority
During each session of GeekHaven it's members and coordis will have the authority to update/delete data dynamically with the help of their login credentials, which will be changed in the next session for its's members

## âœ’ Footnotes
Aim of this project is to reduce the work for the upcoming years, so that the same website can be used without changing any piece of code, just simply update the members details dynamically and you're good to go.
